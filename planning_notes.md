## Planning Notes

#### January 25, 2023

- Started to setup project and work with data

Next steps:
- Owen will explore data and code, discuss more in-depth next week

#### February 1, 2023

- Worked on combining all scraped data into one file and filtering it for pedagogy related terms

Next steps:
- Owen will work on turning his keywords data into a csv file or a list and then exploring frequency of those terms in the data


#### March 8, 2023

- Starting to have our filtered repositories - so now need to decide how to analyze them
- Data we could scrape from filtered repositories:
  - who has starred or forked the repo
  - who has contributed to the repo (whether code or issues)
  - who owns the repo and whether they star or fork or follow other repos in our datasets
- Content within the repository:
  - <https://api.github.com/repos/ZoeLeBlanc/programming_pedagogies/contents/>
  - could download the files and then analyze them
  - could extract the skill/topic from the file name
